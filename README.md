# Temperature Converter in Rust

<img src="https://rustacean.net/assets/rustacean-orig-noshadow.svg" width="200">

Welcome to my Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa converter, built with Rust! This is a simple console application where you can easily convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## How to Use

1. Run the application.
2. The game will prompt you to choose a conversion type:
   - Enter `1` to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
   - Enter `2` to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
3. After selecting the conversion type, you will be prompted to enter the temperature value.
4. The application will then display the converted temperature.

## Installation

To use the converter, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. If you don't have Rust installed, you can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
